## **💾 Memory & Context Management**

Sydney’s **conversation memory** is **persistent, intelligent, and context-aware**:

* Stores **queries and AI responses** in `memory.json`.
* Limits memory to **configurable recent turns** (default: 10) for performance.
* Each query is augmented with **recent conversation context** for:

  * Coherent multi-turn dialogue
  * Avoiding repetition
  * Tailored answers based on user history

**Example Context-Aware Query:**

```
Recent context:
User: I have diabetes and high blood pressure. Can I exercise daily?
Assistant: Light cardio 3-5 times/week, strength training, and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels.

Current query: What dietary changes should I implement alongside exercise?
Assistant: - Low glycemic index foods, high fiber intake...
           - Reduce sodium and processed foods...
           - Maintain protein balance for muscle health...
```

## **📚 Multiple RAG Pipelines for Robust Knowledge Retrieval**

Sydney leverages **multiple RAG systems** for precise answers:

1. **Local Medical Knowledge Base RAG**

   * Curated offline documents on diseases, symptoms, nutrition, and lifestyle.
2. **Granite 47M R2 Embeddings RAG**

   * Embedding-based vector search for **fast, semantic retrieval** of relevant information.
   * Handles **rare, multi-faceted medical queries** with high accuracy.

**Benefits:**

* Multi-topic problem-solving
* Context-enhanced recommendations
* Factually grounded AI responses

---

## **💨 Offline & CPU-Optimized Performance**

Sydney is engineered for **offline, CPU-friendly operation**:

* **Glow-TTS + Multi-band MelGAN** ensures smooth text-to-speech without GPU.
* **Whisper small/int8** allows fast audio transcription on CPU.
* **Precomputed Granite embeddings** for instant retrieval.
* **Chunking long responses** prevents CPU overload.
* **Async threading** ensures non-blocking, fast UI.
* **Persistent memory caching** reduces repeated computation.

> Result: **High-speed inference and audio response**, even on standard CPUs, with **zero reliance on cloud services**.

---

## **💡 Problem-Solving Capabilities**

Sydney is more than a chatbot—it’s a **problem-solving AI assistant**:

* **Multi-step reasoning**: Can combine multiple symptoms, conditions, and treatment options.
* **Cross-topic retrieval**: Uses **RAG + memory + LLM** to synthesize complex guidance.
* **Structured outputs**: Provides bullet points, warnings, and key takeaways for clarity.

## **🌟 Why Sydney Stands Out**

* **Multimodal**: Single version supports **text and voice** seamlessly.
* **Offline & CPU-Optimized**: Works anywhere, no internet needed, fast even on standard CPUs.
* **Memory + Multi-RAG**: Maintains **context**, retrieves **accurate information**, solves **complex problems**.
* **Granite 47M R2 Embeddings**: State-of-the-art retrieval model for **high-fidelity, semantic medical reasoning**.
* **Problem-Solving Ready**: Handles **multi-topic queries, stepwise reasoning, and actionable suggestions**.

**Example Use Case:**

```
User: I have hypertension and mild kidney issues. Can I exercise, and what should I eat?
Assistant: 
- Exercise: Low-impact cardio, yoga, 3-5 times/week
- Diet: Low sodium, moderate protein, avoid processed foods
- Monitor: Blood pressure and kidney function regularly
- Warning: Avoid strenuous exercises that elevate blood pressure rapidly
```
